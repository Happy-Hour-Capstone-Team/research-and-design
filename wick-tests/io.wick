Hello, this is a multiline comment! It doesn't execute
any code and is for documentation purposes. This file
will print "Hello world!" and greet someone based on 
a given name. 
:/

print("Hello world!");
variable name = input("What's your name?");
print("Hello " + name + ".");
print("Nice to meet you!");
